Project 1 read me file

The program is a visual studios 2015 project. The word list files are saved in the project directory.
After starting the program, the user is promped to select a sorting method:
1: Insertion Sort
2: Merge Sort
3: Heap Sort
Next, the user must choose a file size in thousands, such as "30" for 30,000 words in size.
Finally, the user is asked to choose between a permutated list and an already sorted list.
The file will then be processed and an output file generated.
Upon completion, the user is told:
1: The name of the file being sorted.
2: The time elapsed for the sorting procedure (and building the heap if applicable).
3: The name and location of the output file named "output.txt", which will appear in the Project1 folder.
4: The user will be asked if they wish to run the program again, starting with the initial prompt, or if they
wish to exit. All data will be cleared and all heap memory freed, so the user can perform as many runs as desired.
